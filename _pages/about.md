I am a first-year PhD student working with [Prof Miles Cranmer](https://astroautomata.com/) at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. I am also a member of the [Polymathic AI](https://polymathic-ai.org/) collaboration.

My research involves applying modern machine learning techniques to astronomy, and I am currently focusing on building multimodal foundation models for photometric and spectroscopic galaxy surveys.
